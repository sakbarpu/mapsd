Out of 10000000 (10 million) developers active on GitHub
during the year 2018, about 25% of them have made their
"location" publicly available on their profile.
Total number of developers in dataset: 2407950 (~2.5 million)
Total number of times they interacted with GitHub: 319207425
(~300 million)

Top programming languages in order: 
JavaScript, Python, Java

Top countries with most number of developers in order: 
US, China, India

Ukraine is ranked 11 in most number of developers.

There are around 150 developers doing open-source
contributions from Antarctica.

Bots are there (found while exploration of data). They have
names ending in "[bot]" and have the most traffic (commits)
for GitHub. We don't include them in our dataset. One such
bot is greenkeeper[bot]. They come and go.

20 to 100000 commits make sense (again exploratory study).

Filtering for more than 20 and less than 100000 commits
makes sense. Manually analyzed few accounts less than 20 and
they all look newbies. 

Most accounts on github are either bots or newbies. Few are
"experts" having large but reasonable number of commits.

Histogram shows that most users are within 1000 commits.
very few are "experts" and have more than 1000 commits.
